# House Price Prediction Model

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict house prices. The model has been developed for the [House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview/evaluation) on Kaggle.

## 1. Requirements

The project requires the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Warnings
- CatBoost
- LightGBM
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost

Make sure to install these libraries before running the code.

## 2. Overview

The project includes the following steps:

### Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA)

1. General Overview
2. Analysis of Categorical Variables
3. Analysis of Numerical Variables
4. Analysis of Target Variable
5. Correlation Analysis

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

1. Handling Missing Values
2. Outlier Analysis and Treatment
3. Rare Analysis and Encoding
4. Creating New Features

### Model Building

Several regression models are implemented, including:

- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

### Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on a cross-validated basis.

## 3. Usage

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Install the required libraries.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

Feel free to experiment with different models or adjust hyperparameters for better performance.

## 4. Submission

To submit predictions to Kaggle, run the model on the test dataset, create a CSV file with the predicted prices, and upload it to the competition platform.

Good luck with your house price predictions!
